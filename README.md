## Configuration

### Efficiency Model Parameters

```python
efficiency_score = 100 - (
    sp_weight * sp_cost + 
    attribute_weight * (attribute_gain * difficulty_modifier)
)
```

- **SP Weight:** Emphasizes cost efficiency  
- **Attribute Weight:** Prioritizes stat improvement  
- **Difficulty Modifier:** `1 + (final_attribute / 100)` to account for diminishing returns  

### Database Schema

- **upgrades:** All upgrade paths with costs and stat gains  
- **archetypes:** Player archetype definitions  
- **tiers:** Tier requirements and thresholds
